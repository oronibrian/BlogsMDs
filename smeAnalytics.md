## Startups and Data Analytics
Data is an asset. The impact of data usage extends well beyond business and daily operations of an organization.
The idea of big data and startups companies is not well open to many startups in kenya. When it comes to the term 'Data Analysis' many small business enterprice think of it as a big organization thing,we dont own big loads of data.

This ideas of we are not big yet should be stopped by all startups and start embressing data analysis and the start of the of there organization journey.
For startups and SMEs, the fundamental advantage is that it enables growth, which is the prime core value of being in existence.

Through Data analytics startups can  uncover hidden opportunities, identify trends and patterns, problem areas and successes,that people may not be able to ascertain.(NB I know you are asking yourself but we dont have the data?. There are many open source data projects that can help boost your data analytics startup journey,we would talk about this in future posts.)

## The Journey Process
The big data concept does not only involve cleaning and analysing data.
In the early stages of the startup, it is key for the company to look at engagement metrics and feedback from users,they first need to understand their markets,products and customers,and data analytics will come later on.
No much cost is incured at this stage of the journey,several free tools are available for use at this point,like Google Analytics.
Another challenge that many startups dont look at data analytics is because they were occupied by other tasks.

Smaller businesses need to appreciate the value that data provides, and allocate their time accordingly.
